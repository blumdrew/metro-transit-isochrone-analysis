            # Using Transit Travel Times to Judge the Metro 2040 Plan
            ##### An analysis by *[Andrew Lindstrom](www.city-hikes.com)*
            ---

            If you believe the hype, the [Metro 2040 Growth Plan](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/2040-growth-concept) has a lot going for it.
            For the unaware, Metro is the Portland area's Metropolitan Planning Organization, which is something every metro area has, primarily
            to direct transportation funding. What makes Metro unusual is that it has both taxing power (as evidenced by the much maligned
            homeless supportive services tax), and that it has an elected body governing it. As an urban planner, this is exactly the kind of situation
            we dream of. Even non-urban planners have been known to be fans of a metropolitan government with teeth - most "famous" of them being
            the former mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler (I just read his autobiography).

            Over the years, Metro has been in the driver's seat for a lot of land use policy in the Portland area. The two primary powers that Metro
            retains as it relates to land use planning are the ability to review local government's Comprehensive Plans for compatability with the
            Metro Comprehensive plan (a.k.a the 2040 Growth Plan), and the authority to update the region's urban growth boundary (UGB). I could not find specific
            examples of the Metro council overruling a city's plans - but clashes over the UGB are the norm. In 2011, [a bill](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/bill-to-take-away-metro-s-planning-authority-scheduled-for-friday-hearing)
            was introduced to strip Metro of their power over the UGB (to no avail). Evidently, it's more politically feasible to have cities have 
            just one more layer of bureaucracy (UGB expansions are reviewed by the state anyways) rather than forcing them to throw out plans which 
            are likely a genuine reflection of the mood of the place.

            A brief read of the 2040 Growth Plan shows a great deal of thought, care, and effort put into orderly growth aimed at protecting 
            rural lands from sprawl, promoting transportation options, and enhancing the livability of the Portland region. But the unwillingness of Metro
            to meaningfully change any places plans to match the 2040 Growth Plan means it is easily regulated to the back burner. It means that places
            like Oregon City - designated as a Regional Center since day 1 - still have not officially adopted it in their plans.
